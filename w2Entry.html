        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>
          <strong class="Situation">Situation:</strong> Week 2 has introduced me
          to some basics in HTML and CSS on one front, and SQL on the other. I
          only previously had some minor experience in HTML so getting hands on
          with it has been a good breather from the the less intuitive world of
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong class="Task">Task:</strong> For SQL, tasks this week involved
          creating tables (databases) and playing around with the lanagauge to
          achievve different outcomes and outputs. On reflection, while this
          introducttion is quite simplified, I will need some repetition to
          ensure the format and commands are memorised as distinct from the
          other languages my cohort is juggling. The big task with HTML/CSS is
          the creation of this journal; this has involved trial and error to
          create functioning pages.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong class="Action">Action:</strong> My primary action has been to
          visualise what I believe I can create against my level of current
          compentency. I think this has helped me personally because its given
          me a sense of direction in what I need to research in order to find
          the coding that provides the desired HTML/CSS function.
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />
          <strong class="Result">Result:</strong> As a first attmpt at a
          HTML/CSS webpage, I think I've produced something themed, uniformed,
          and open for further improvements as the weeks progress. My actions
          going forward will focus on trying to really embed how the syntax
          between HTML and CSS interact. I've definitely found this a bit more
          engrossing, and that's perhaps because it has a UX element to it which
          is allowing me to visualise what I want to create.
