        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>
          <strong class="Situation">Situation:</strong> Having reflected on why I'm not retaining as much information as I'd like, I think the technical issues of the first week has stolen vital time away from Javascript fundamentals. Additionally, having two weeks away from JavaScript to focus on HTML, CSS and SQL, wihtout retreading the heavily disrupted first week, as well as a lack of immediate JavaScript repetition has - in my personal experience - proven to be detrimental to learning.

          <!-- <strong class="Task">Task:</strong> I've identified functions as the biggest source of confusion. The task will be to find extra time outside of the bootcamp to retread this area using other resources; something I have already done to no avail. This is vital if I am to evidence engagement with sites such as CodeWars, which I currently find too difficult to even guess without some base knowledge of how the syntax should work and be formatted. Without that knowldege I have no iniative to solve puzzles on resources such as CodeWars. 
         <br>
         <br> 
          Having also moved onto JS DOM (Document Object Model), and feeling quite overwhlemed at the autonomous leap from where we left off in Week 1, I recognise the need to tailor learning if I am to really benefit from the bootcamp. Talking about the code I have so far written for DOM would be empty talk because I still feel there is insufficent context behind each syntax. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong class="Action">Action:</strong> I have attempted to fill gaps and fusion with W3, revisting bootcamp slides, and CodeWars, but again - I find these provide insufficent context for application. I have began a JavScript course on Mimo, which is a phone app that breaks down everything to the extreme and works quite well for context; the downside is you cannot jump to different sections, meaning it could be a while before I reach Functions. I have also put CodeAcademy on my agenda to walk me through Functions.
