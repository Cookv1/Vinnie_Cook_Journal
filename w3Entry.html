        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p>
          <strong class="Situation">Situation:</strong> Presently, I have been doing my weekly entries the following week. I felt this would give me a short reflective period to process what I learned. What is alarming me is that I am struggling to remember what I covered the previous week in any real detail, and this tells me the current approach of the bootcamp is not necessarilly working for me. This is quite frustrating as I am eager to showcase authentic development.

          <strong class="Task">Task:</strong> Copy and pasting answers is not an effective learning method for me. Just getting something done is also not a productive learning approach. I like to digest, understand, and have context behind each and every syntax introduced. For whatever factors, that is not currently happening for me, and I am not too shy or proud to admit it. The task going forward will be to reevaluate what I can realistically take from the bootcamp.

          <strong class="Action">Action:</strong> This journal is going to become my audit. If I cannot recall each previous week in my reflections, then I certainly cannot evidence true progress. I am here, I am present, and I believe myself to be an intelligent person; if I am to problem solve I first need to set myself the action of tailoring this experience to suit my own learning style. I know how I learn best, and if posed with the pathways of actually learning something but not completing the bootcamp, or copy and pasting my way to the end, I know which pathway I choose.

          <strong class="Result">Result:</strong> There is no defined result this week, but rather an entension of the previous two weeks. I am maintaining emotional intelligence against great frustration, but that has little to do with technical compentency which is why I am here. I do however remain hopeful that I will look back in weeks to come and be able to recognise some shift in competency, and I also recognise I may be being hard on myself, and in reality, at the right level of progress.
