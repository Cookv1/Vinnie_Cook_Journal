        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>
          <strong class="Situation">Situation:</strong> Week 1 introduced me to some basic
          JavaScript fundamentals. While I can recognize some of the language,
          by the end point of the week, I still feel unable to spontaneously type
          code. I think much of this is rooted in the reality that JavaScript is
          not the most intuitive language, and I will naturally be feeling
          overwhelmed in this introductory week. The project set at the end of
          the week was to solve some coding challenges and upload them via
          various channels after making a repository - all new to me, and all
          very confusing at this start point.

          <strong class="Task">Task:</strong> I would like to get to a place where I can type
          code without searching for the answers. To do this, I needed to
          identify the root cause of most confusion, and this has been
          identified as functions. My second task is to resolve as many of the
          technical issues on my end as possible, in order to reduce the overall
          barriers (including those I cannot directly resolve). These technical
          issues have limited live-time participation, and this has undoubtedly
          meant information has not embedded and not resulted in a staggered
          learning experience as I hop between past and present topics.

        <p>
          <strong class="Action">Action:</strong> My first action was to let the teacher know
          my concerns, so some of the issues could be tackled - such as
          technical barriers. My next action was to consider how best to develop
          myself out of the boot camp so I can visit the content it skims past in
          greater detail. For this, I began JavaScript on a mobile app that breaks
          it down into baby steps and provides repetition.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          <strong class="Result">Result:</strong> For me, Week 1 was more a reminder of those
          soft skills which are essential to counter emotions like frustration.
          After reflecting, I concluded I was being hard on myself. I would love
          to be able to list the things I have learned in Week 1, but the
          distinctions are not yet there for me without reviewing content. What
          I can say is proactivity beyond the boot camp will be key. If anything,
          the boot camp is exposing the areas I need to give more attention to -
          such as functions.
